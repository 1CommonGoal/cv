<h1>My Studies</h1>
<p>Here's where I keep track of 3 of my hobbies that I love. Hobbies that I practice so that I can one<br> day start companies based on these hobbies. In the topics below you'll find a description<br> of the topic, then my past, current and future endeavors.</p>
<p>Note: The projects described below are projects that I've done myself. I'm not including information<br>where I've helped anyone, nor stuff I've done in other companies.</p>

<h3><strong>Software Programming</strong></h3>
    <p>Just imagining what I can create with software programming, it has become a fun hobby for me. But I don't<br>just want to create personal projects with it, I want to have a job using code as well. Here<br>are the 5 programming languages I want to be able to code with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/1891/html5">HTML5</a> - I'm using HTML5 to markup this webpage.</li>
        <li>CSS3 - CSS3 is being used to style this webpage</li>
        <li>Javascript - is being used to make this webpage interactive.</li>
        <li>Python - is also incorporated in this webpage</li>
        <li>C++ - I use C++ in game development.</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Past: So far I've studied HTML5, CSS3, Python, and C++. I've incorporated Javascript in this list,<br>even though I haven't really studied it because it usually goes with HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. I<br>wouldn't have incorporated Python in this list because it seems to be about the same as Javascript,<br>but I've already studied it so I'm keeping it in the list. </li>
        <li>Present: I'm currently studying HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. I'm currently studying these right now because it's the fastest way for me to get a job writing code.</li>
        <li>Future: After studying HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript, I'm going to continue with C++. I want to have a job writing code by the end of 2023.</li>
    </ol>

<h3>Carpentry</h3>
    <p>Construction hasn't been something that I've had a passion for in the past. Then I decided that if I<br>didn't want to spend 25 years paying a mortgage I should probably learn to build a house. So I went to<br>school at Avtec for Construction Technology and learned how to build a house from the ground. And<br>because of all this learning I've developed a passion for building because I knew what I was doing.<br>And I have the confidence to build whatever I put my mind to.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Past: I built the shell of my house in Wasilla in fall of 2021, shown in the picture above. Other than that I haven't built anything else.</li>
        <li>Present: Presently I'm waiting to finish building my house this summer.</li>
        <li>Future: I want to eventually start a company building <a href="https://www.tinyhomebuilders.com/tiny-houses">tiny houses on trailers</a>, built for winter and has everything, and selling them.</li>
    </ol>

<h3>Still Development/Distillation</h3>
    <p>Eventually I want to start a company making and selling <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/what-are-essential-oils">essential oils</a>. I've spent a long time reading<br> and studying about the distillation process. I love science and want to use this knowledge to provide<br>healing essential oils to whomever sees the healing benefits of them and takes advantage of it.</p>

    <img src="images\ForcedRefluxStill.jpg" alt="forcedRefluxStillPicture" width="150" height="175">
    <ol>
        <li>Past: These stills above are the stills that I've made myself. The pot still is for making the essential<br> oils. The forced reflux still was made for fun. I studied what forced reflux is and how to do it and made<br> this still just because I can.</li>
        <li>Present: At the moment I'm not creating any essential oils nor am I collecting plants to make essential oils<br>with my current stills. For one thing it's winter in Alaska and secondly I'm too busy during the summers to collect various plants.</li>
        <li>Future: I want to build a big still made specifically for extracting essential oils. Then using it to start<br>my essential oils company.</li>
    </ol>
